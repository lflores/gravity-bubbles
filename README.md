# gravity-bubbles

> This component, using d3js API, draw animated bubbles chart with gravity

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lflores/gravity-bubbles.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lflores/gravity-bubbles)


## Features
This is a visual component that draw a chart with centered gravity based on [d3](http://d3js.org/) API library.

Based on [Jim Vallandingham Blog Post](http://vallandingham.me/bubble_charts_in_d3.html), [Obamaâ€™s 2013 Budget Proposal](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/02/13/us/politics/2013-budget-proposal-graphic.html?_r=0) and [Automobile Force](http://projects.delimited.io/experiments/force-bubbles/radial.html), Gravity Bubbles it's a component that draw a collection of bubbles, and allow the user to compare data attributes by color and size. 

The main characteristic is the "gravity" to center, and hence its name. 

![Gravity Bubbles Grouping](http://rawgit.com/lflores/gravity-bubbles/master/src/images/gravity-bubbles-grouping.gif)

Also the component include 3 views:
* "all" view with unique center in center of chart
* "color" view, that are bubbles grouped by color fences, as vertical bands.
* A free group that is a name of property of data that can be used to group data, (such as country, category, contact id, etc).

### Some features
* Tooltip templated configuration
* Label templated configuration
* Animated transitions
* Size comparizons
* Group data capability
* Easy color schema changes
* Adaptable data legend
* All items are visibles, including negatives and smallest data


## Examples
#### Default:

#### Grouping by color:

#### Grouping by category:

#### [Flare Example](http://lflores.github.com/flare/)
Based on common tree data "flare", and using D3js library, this example shows bubbles grouped in center (force), like earth gravity, with distinct sizes and colors, you can dive into data hierarchy.

[Please show me](http://lflores.github.com/flare/)

#### [Evolution Example](http://lflores.github.com/evolution/)
Based on D3js library, this example shows the evolution of bubbles through time, loading data in asynchronous form, under demand. Or you can push play to automate the action.

#### [Martian Example](http://lflores.github.com/martian/)(Thanks to [headwins](https://github.com/headwinds))
In the year 2030, we face a new form of global conscription. Since we've ruined our planet, NATO has ordered the remaining population to board the fleet of Dragon class drop ships headed for that distant red rock in the sky which we'll have to now call home. Many are seeking asylum status in Southeast Asia to avoid ruining another planet.

#### [Gravity Label](http://jsfiddle.net/6cLpuL7j/)
This fiddle example shows how to configure the component for adaptable label to enabled space

#### Colors Changes:
It's easy to change bubble colors, setting points and colors arrays.

## Get started
If you want to see it in action, go to [jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/leoflores/6cLpuL7j/) that explain some concepts of use, and show how to change some properties. Or if you want to see a more complex use, please go to [gravity-bubbles](http://lflores.github.com/flare)
Currently I'm documenting the project, and please, [contact me](https://github.com/lflores/gravity-bubbles/issues) if you want to help or discovered some issue.
To start using it, you must to download this proyect, and solve next dependencies.

## Dependencies:

## Callbacks
When the user click on bubble, a <strong>click</strong> is fired to comunicate that values have been clicked. It can be used to do a drilldown
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Event</th>
        <th>Property</th>
        <th>Value</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>click</strong></td>
        <td>d</td>
        <td>Data Clicked</td>
    </tr>
</table>


## Plugin api
#### jQuery

```javascript
$(function() {
    // instantiate the plugin
    
    chart = new GravityBubbles({
                id: "vis",
                sizeById: "size",
                colorById: "perc",
                data: {
                    tooltip: function(d) {
                        //Parameter d is clicked data
                        //You can return a string template
                        return "<b>Name:</b>{name}<br><b>Size:</b> {size}<br><b>Size of Total:</b> {perc}%";
                    },
                    label: {
                        //{name} Indicates that will try to show property value called name
                        template : "{name}\n{perc}%",
                        //Force the label to fill bubble and scale it
                        autofit: true
                    },

                    onclick: function(d) {
                        //Parameter d is clicked data
                    }
                }
            });
});
```
